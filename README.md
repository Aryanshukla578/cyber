## **How It Works**
1. **Threat Analysis**:
   - Detects suspicious network activity using machine learning.
   - Analyzes incoming and outgoing packets to identify threats.
   
2. **Firewall Mitigation**:
   - A custom-built firewall written in Python, C++, and JavaScript.
   - Dynamically blocks unauthorized access and suspicious IPs.

3. **Attack Tracking**:
   - Logs all malicious activities, including IP address, payload, and timestamp.
   - Generates detailed reports for further analysis.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can monitor detected threats and their mitigation status via the appâ€™s dashboard.
   - Provides actionable insights to improve security configurations.
